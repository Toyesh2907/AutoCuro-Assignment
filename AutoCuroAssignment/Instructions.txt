Instructions:

import the model with correct directory input since i have imported it using my local path

To play the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you need to run all the cells in the TicTacToeGame jupyter notebook.

The input for each move should be an integer between 0 and 8, indicating the index on the board as shown below:

0 | 1 | 2 
--|---|---
3 | 4 | 5 
--|---|---
6 | 7 | 8 

If you choose a value greater than 8 or select a position that has already been played, you will need to restart the cell to play again.

The game continue until either you or the model wins or draws


Note:
I have attached all the necessary scripts and datasets csv files needed to retrain the model if you want just change the directory path for each
